# Population

60 inhabitants per square kilometer is an average figure for the entire Alpine region. We take into account the challenging mountainous environment where permanent settlement areas are limited. We may consider the area of permanent settlement as the basis for population density. The figure increases fourfold when we do, comparable to some of the most densely populated regions globally (CIPRA). The Alps are home to more than 14 million people. It increased from the population size 150 years ago when it was approximately half the current size. The population concentrates in easily accessible mountain valleys (Alpine Convention).

> The Alpine economy is based on a symbiosis of diverse sectors: tourism, services, industry, electricity generation, and agriculture.
