# Climate Zone

Temperature decreases with altitude.

*Lapse rate: The rate of temperature drop with elevation*

The temperature drops as you ascend in elevation. Temperatures are relatively mild and vary with the seasons at lower elevations in the valleys. Temperatures are cooler, and snow cover is common in winter in higher elevations, especially in the Alpine regions. The Alps receive precipitation - snow at higher elevations during the winter months. Precipitation levels vary. They depend on the side of the mountains. Windward sides typically face west. They receive more precipitation as moist air is lifted over the mountains and cools, forming clouds. Summers are mild to warm. The valleys experience warmer temperatures. Higher altitudes remain cooler. The Alps exhibit microclimates. Exposure to prevailing winds varies.

Winds affect the climate in certain areas. They cause rapid changes in precipitation.

Architects in the Alps region design buildings that respond to the local climate. They use appropriate roof materials that can bear the accumulated snow's weight. Exposure to prevailing winds varies. Designs harness these winds. The Alps exhibit microclimates, and architects should be aware of these variations. Designing with knowledge local microclimates optimizes comfort within buildings. Architects consider resilience to natural landslide hazards given the mountainous terrain. Architects choose building materials to enhance safety.
