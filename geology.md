# Geology

Sedimentary rocks reflect ancient marine environments. Sediments metamorphosed into marble rocks. They were subjected to intense tectonic forces during mountain-building events. Magmatic intrusions occurred during the mountain range's formation. Granite rocks reflect them. The tectonic activity in the region goes on. It continues to uplift the Alps. Natural weathering processes drive erosion. It alters the landscape.
