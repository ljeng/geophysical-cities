# Geology

Sedimentary rocks reflect ancient marine environments. Sediments metamorphosed into marble rocks. They were subjected to intense tectonic forces during mountain-building events. Magmatic intrusions occurred during the mountain range's formation. Granite rocks reflect them. The tectonic activity in the region goes on. It continues to uplift the Alps. Natural weathering processes drive erosion. It alters the landscape.

> *Regional map of the European Alps with simplified geology, highlighting the position of the Bergell. Detrital records of erosion of the Bergell are preserved in the Gonfolite Lombarda Group, 100 km south of the Bergell. The Alpine internal units are separated from the Southern Alps by the Periadriatic Line, referred to as the Insubric Line south of the Bergell. Modified from Reverman et al.*

Granite is a common intrusive rock. Volcanic andesite and basalt rocks are found in some regions. These rocks contain fossils. They reveal the region's geological history. Glaciers in the Alps form in high-altitude regions. Softer rocks produce valleys. Sedimentary limestone rocks affect glacial meltwater's chemical composition. Glaciers carve on the underlying rocks.

*Cirque: amphitheater-like hollow*

*Arête: narrow ridge*

Erosional cirque and arête landforms result from this action. Depositional features include moraines. They're glacial debris accumulations. Terminal moraines mark past glaciers' furthest extent (Fox, et al).
Architects choose construction materials. Planners understand how glaciers and erosion shaped the landscape. The natural weathering processes create geological rockfall risks. Planners mitigate these risks.
