# Dynamic Forces

Avalanche, glacier, and snowfall studies span the geomorphology discipline. Glacial meltwater sustains ecosystems downstream. Changes in glacier behavior has cascading effects on the entire ecosystem.

### Glaciers

Glaciers are critical for water resource management. Understanding glacier dynamics assesses freshwater resource availability, especially during dry seasons when glacier melt sustains river flow for sustainable water resource planning in regions that depend on glacier-fed rivers. Glaciers indicate climate change. We monitor changes in glacier size. This provides valuable information about long-term climate trends. The study of glaciers reveals climate change impacts. It refines climate models.

### Avalanches

### Snowfall

Studying snowfall patterns helps manage winter tourism. Agriculture depends on seasonal snowmelt. Monitoring snowpack conditions helps manage it.
