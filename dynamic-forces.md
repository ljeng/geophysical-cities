# Dynamic Forces

Avalanche, glacier, and snowfall studies span the geomorphology discipline. Glacial meltwater sustains ecosystems downstream. Changes in glacier behavior has cascading effects on the entire ecosystem.

### Glaciers

Glaciers are critical for water resource management. Understanding glacier dynamics assesses freshwater resource availability, especially during dry seasons when glacier melt sustains river flow for sustainable water resource planning in regions that depend on glacier-fed rivers. Glaciers indicate climate change. We monitor changes in glacier size. This provides valuable information about long-term climate trends. The study of glaciers reveals climate change impacts. It refines climate models.

### Avalanches

Human activities, falling rocks, and explosives for avalanche control trigger avalanches. The exposure of people to cryosphere hazards in high mountain regions has increased over recent decades and is expected to continue in the future. Weakly regulated infrastructure expansion increases exposure in some regions. Mountain communities, especially in developing countries, are highly vulnerable to enhanced cryosphere hazards's adverse effects. Some mountain communities exhibit enhanced resilience levels from long-standing experience. Cryosphere-related landslides have severe impacts on lives. Glacier lake outburst floods alone have caused deaths over the past two centuries in regions. Economic losses result from indirect costs like vital transportation corridor disruption, tourism earnings loss, and cultural disruption from permanent evacuation. Vulnerability will grow without adaptation in the coming century. Risk reduction strategies will be required to avoid increased impacts.

### Snowfall

Studying snowfall patterns helps manage winter tourism. Agriculture depends on seasonal snowmelt. Monitoring snowpack conditions helps manage it.
