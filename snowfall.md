# Snowfall

Snowfall.

### Hydropower

The snow accumulates in the high-altitude regions. It maintains glaciers. Melting glaciers provide a steady water source to rivers. The water source then produces hydropower. Snowfall varies seasonally. It directly impacts the water resources' availability for hydropower. Snowfall fluctuates. Snowmelt varies in magnitude. There may be a decrease in snow accumulation. There's reduced water availability during peak demand periods. Conversely, heavy snowfall increases water supply during the melting season. This potentially allows higher hydropower production. Glaciers retreat in the Alps. Climate change has caused this. Meltwater volume that glaciers provide rivers decreases as they shrink. Hydropower facilities release water during lower flow periods. Water availability varies. This manages it. We may predict glacier behavior accurately. These water management strategies' efficiency depends on this.
